      <description>Yesterday I volunteered for one hour to speak at a career panel.
The panel was organized by GOKiC (Geeking Out Kids of Color) and Collective Youth.
I helped start GOKiC as a board member.
Recently, I stepped out as a board member.
It was really great to see the work of the non profit from the point of view of a volunteer.
It made me really proud to see how organized and big the organization has grown.</description>
