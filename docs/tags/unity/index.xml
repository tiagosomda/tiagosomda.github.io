      <description>How did I stumble onto HomeTeam GameDev? I had been looking for a place where I could collaborate with others on a game.
This is something I already do with some friends. However, I wanted to do it in a more global scale.
I started looking into open source games and I did find quite a few, but the games themselves were already pretty well stabilished and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see much about what I could do on them.</description>

      <description>Have you heard of Superluminal? If not, check it out!
I really enjoyed playing it : link to Superluminal on Steam
The puzzles are incredible.
It has this game mechanic that tricks your mind. Even when you understand it, it still leaves you in awe.
If you know me, you know where this is going&amp;hellip;
I wondered how would it feel to interact with this game mechanic in the real world.</description>
