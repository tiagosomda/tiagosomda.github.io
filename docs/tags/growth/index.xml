      <description>I have recently read &amp;lsquo;The Mental Load: A Feminist Comic&amp;rsquo; By Emma and I learned a lot! As I read each chapter, I took notes and today I reflected on them. I highly recommend this book to the women and men of your life.
What is this book about? This review by Nancy O&amp;rsquo;Toole explains it well
The mental load is an intersectional feminist comic that uses simple illustrations to convey current issues.</description>

I love Disney, but I never really knew anything about their CEO so I looked him up.
and guess what?
He has done some pretty amazing shit!
I watched a couple of interviews he gave and I really liked the way he talked:</description>
