careerMissionTitle: Tech Interests

missions:
- term: XR (eXtended Reality)
  info: This domain is the tech I am most passionated about it. I can see myself retiring wearing an XR headset (or lenses!).
  
- term: Decentralization
  info: There are cons and pros with decentralized systems. However, I personally see more pros than cons. My favorite initiatives are [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), [Solid.mit.edu](https://solid.mit.edu) / [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com). Blockchain is foundation for it, but as you can see with Solid and Inrupt, not everything needs to be on a blockchain.

- term: Artificial Intelligence
  info: AI is changing the world. We need to make sure that we create AIs in an ethical and open way so that everyone can benefit from the power that this technology can bring. There will be private AI entities, but like Linux, the foundation should be open to all.

# - term: XR (eXtended Reality)
#   info: As you can see in my career mission, XR is a big passion of mine. From the first time I tried it, I saw that this technology had so many possibilities. You could "be" as big as a galaxy or as little as a blood cell. As time has passed, the opportunities that this tech can create are immense. I like to say that VR is a tool for empathy. It can really put you in the shoes of someone else.

# - term: Artificial Intelligence
#   info: AI is changing the world. In my opinion, we need to make sure that AI is created in way that can help people do their jobs more efficiently so we can achieve more as a society. I don't believe that AI will replace humans. I think it will be something similar to how when TVs came out, everyone thought we would stop reading, or when books came out, everyone thought that we would stop telling stories. I think AI will change the world as we know it in many ways, but it won't replace humans entirely. We humans will find ways to keep busy and creating value to society in one way or another.
