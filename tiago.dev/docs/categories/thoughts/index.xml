      <description>so! üòäüòç
Today marks 1 year since I started my career as a professional gameplay engineer!
yay!
TL;DR:
12 year old Tiago would be proud! ‚ù§Ô∏è 32 year old Tiago is loving the change and still learning every day. Who did I write this for? myself.
I am not spending a lot of energy on making sure other people will be able to understand what I wrote. This is a reflection and celebration that I want to record for future Tiago.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; and dealing with leaving my confort zone
I left my job&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. Last week.
In a few days, I start my new job as a Gameplay Engineer at Red Storm.
Time off &amp;hellip; before next adventure!
I had one week off between job, so my wife and I went to visit family and meet our new niece.
I filled my iddle time with prepping for my new role, playing video games and I started feeling a wide set of of emotions regarding what this new chapter in my professional life would be like.</description>

      <title>First Week @ HomeTeam GameDev</title>

      <description>How did I stumble onto HomeTeam GameDev? I had been looking for a place where I could collaborate with others on a game.
This is something I already do with some friends. However, I wanted to do it in a more global scale.
I started looking into open source games and I did find quite a few, but the games themselves were already pretty well stabilished and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see much about what I could do on them.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I volunteered for one hour to speak at a career panel.
The panel was organized by GOKiC (Geeking Out Kids of Color) and Collective Youth.
I helped start GOKiC as a board member.
Recently, I stepped out as a board member.
It was really great to see the work of the non profit from the point of view of a volunteer.
It made me really proud to see how organized and big the organization has grown.</description>

      <description>Do you have a well defined motto?
I did not, but now I do Why&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I define a motto for myself?
Defining my motto came from the time where I took a class that my manager recommended. The class was called &amp;ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&amp;rdquo; and I took it online through Seattle community college.
Thank you Microsoft for sponsoring it! The class is part of a course series called &amp;ldquo;Leadership&amp;rdquo; How &amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I come up with my motto?</description>

      <description>Why am I starting a blog? I am creating this blog as a sort of a personal growth record keeping.
The posts I am creating are usually around the areas of:
books I am reading or listening to my endless quest of working on projects a public &amp;ldquo;fuck yeah list&amp;rdquo; Books As I read and listen to book, I take notes. Doing that really helps to critically understand what I am reading and it helps to retain knowledge.</description>
