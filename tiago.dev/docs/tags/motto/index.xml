      <description>Do you have a well defined motto?
I did not, but now I do Why&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I define a motto for myself?
Defining my motto came from the time where I took a class that my manager recommended. The class was called &amp;ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&amp;rdquo; and I took it online through Seattle community college.
Thank you Microsoft for sponsoring it! The class is part of a course series called &amp;ldquo;Leadership&amp;rdquo; How &amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I come up with my motto?</description>
