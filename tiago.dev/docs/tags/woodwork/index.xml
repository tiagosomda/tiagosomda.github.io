      <description>Why did I build a table? My work desk was bending after about 1 year of working from home.
My office equipment is actually pretty heavy.
So I decided to build a table!
Why not just buy one? I like building things.
and some youtube videos claimed I could make one for under $100.
and the biggest reasons were that if I build one:
would be fun! I would learn a new skill!</description>
