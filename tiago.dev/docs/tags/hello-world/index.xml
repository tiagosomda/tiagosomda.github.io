      <description>Do you have a well defined motto?
I did not, but now I do Why&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I define a motto for myself?
Defining my motto came from the time where I took a class that my manager recommended. The class was called &amp;ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&amp;rdquo; and I took it online through Seattle community college.
Thank you Microsoft for sponsoring it! The class is part of a course series called &amp;ldquo;Leadership&amp;rdquo; How &amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I come up with my motto?</description>

      <description>Why am I starting a blog? I am creating this blog as a sort of a personal growth record keeping.
The posts I am creating are usually around the areas of:
books I am reading or listening to my endless quest of working on projects a public &amp;ldquo;fuck yeah list&amp;rdquo; Books As I read and listen to book, I take notes. Doing that really helps to critically understand what I am reading and it helps to retain knowledge.</description>
