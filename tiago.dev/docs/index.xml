      <description>so! üòäüòç
Today marks 1 year since I started my career as a professional gameplay engineer!
yay!
TL;DR:
12 year old Tiago would be proud! ‚ù§Ô∏è 32 year old Tiago is loving the change and still learning every day. Who did I write this for? myself.
I am not spending a lot of energy on making sure other people will be able to understand what I wrote. This is a reflection and celebration that I want to record for future Tiago.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; and dealing with leaving my confort zone
I left my job&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. Last week.
In a few days, I start my new job as a Gameplay Engineer at Red Storm.
Time off &amp;hellip; before next adventure!
I had one week off between job, so my wife and I went to visit family and meet our new niece.
I filled my iddle time with prepping for my new role, playing video games and I started feeling a wide set of of emotions regarding what this new chapter in my professional life would be like.</description>

      <description>How did I stumble onto HomeTeam GameDev? I had been looking for a place where I could collaborate with others on a game.
This is something I already do with some friends. However, I wanted to do it in a more global scale.
I started looking into open source games and I did find quite a few, but the games themselves were already pretty well stabilished and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see much about what I could do on them.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I volunteered for one hour to speak at a career panel.
The panel was organized by GOKiC (Geeking Out Kids of Color) and Collective Youth.
I helped start GOKiC as a board member.
Recently, I stepped out as a board member.
It was really great to see the work of the non profit from the point of view of a volunteer.
It made me really proud to see how organized and big the organization has grown.</description>

      <description>I have recently read &amp;lsquo;The Mental Load: A Feminist Comic&amp;rsquo; By Emma and I learned a lot! As I read each chapter, I took notes and today I reflected on them. I highly recommend this book to the women and men of your life.
What is this book about? This review by Nancy O&amp;rsquo;Toole explains it well
The mental load is an intersectional feminist comic that uses simple illustrations to convey current issues.</description>

      <title>Hello, World! Here is my motto</title>

      <description>Do you have a well defined motto?
I did not, but now I do Why&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I define a motto for myself?
Defining my motto came from the time where I took a class that my manager recommended. The class was called &amp;ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&amp;rdquo; and I took it online through Seattle community college.
Thank you Microsoft for sponsoring it! The class is part of a course series called &amp;ldquo;Leadership&amp;rdquo; How &amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; did I come up with my motto?</description>

      <title>My first table!</title>

      <description>Why did I build a table? My work desk was bending after about 1 year of working from home.
My office equipment is actually pretty heavy.
So I decided to build a table!
Why not just buy one? I like building things.
and some youtube videos claimed I could make one for under $100.
and the biggest reasons were that if I build one:
would be fun! I would learn a new skill!</description>

      <description>Have you heard of Superluminal? If not, check it out!
I really enjoyed playing it : link to Superluminal on Steam
The puzzles are incredible.
It has this game mechanic that tricks your mind. Even when you understand it, it still leaves you in awe.
If you know me, you know where this is going&amp;hellip;
I wondered how would it feel to interact with this game mechanic in the real world.</description>

      <description>Why am I starting a blog? I am creating this blog as a sort of a personal growth record keeping.
The posts I am creating are usually around the areas of:

      <guid>https://www.tiago.dev/posts/books/lessons-from-bob-iger/</guid>
      <description>Why am I reading a book about lessons from a CEO? I heard about Bob Iger after reading an article that mentioned that the CEO of Disney was thinking of running for the president of the USA.
I love Disney, but I never really knew anything about their CEO so I looked him up.
and guess what?
He has done some pretty amazing shit!
I watched a couple of interviews he gave and I really liked the way he talked:</description>
