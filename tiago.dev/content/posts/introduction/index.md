Do you have a well defined motto?
- I did not, but now I do

# Why...
... did I define a motto for myself?
   
Defining my motto came from the time where I took a class that my manager recommended. 
The class was called "How To Make Great Decisions" and I took it online through Seattle community college.
- Thank you Microsoft for sponsoring it!
- The class is part of a course series called "Leadership"

# How ...
... did I come up with my motto?
  
In that class,  
I had to keep a daily journal.  
One of the questions I had to answer in one of these days was "What is your motto?"

When the question was posed to me,  
my mind went straight to a message that I used to written on a mirror right outside my bedroom.  
- The message was "The Staying Speed = The Right Effort + Time".  

This was something I came up with a long time ago when I used to practice Jeet Kune Do.  
- I was really immersed in Bruce Lee's life philosophy and all the quotes/teachings that he had.
- From these learnings and practices, I derived that mental formula (right effort plus time equals the staying speed) 

# What ...
... is **"The Staying Speed"** ? 

## to me
...about finding the right amount of time and effort needed to reach a goal.  
- Put too little effort and time (how often you do something) and you won't accomplish it.  
- Put too much effort and time and you might get burned out, bored, etc.  

## in other words
1. The right balance of the amount of effort and time you put into a goal.  
2. The speed is not always the same.
   - It depends not only on what you are working on, but your emotional state as well. 
3. Knowing that, allows you to
   - recognize when it is too little and when it is too much.
   - From there you can adjust your staying speed to accomplish your goal.
