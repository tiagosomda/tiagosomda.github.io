## Why am I starting a blog?

I am creating this blog as a sort of a personal growth record keeping.

The posts I am creating are usually around the areas of:
- books I am reading or listening to
- my endless quest of working on projects 
- a public "fuck yeah list"

### Books
As I read and listen to book, I take notes.
Doing that really helps to critically understand what I am reading and it helps to retain knowledge.

In short words, this method goes like this:
- write what you think you are going to be reading
- read a chapter
- write about what you have just read
- before you start reading the book again, read through your notes

Here are some videos on the method I described:
- [Big Think : How to remember everything you read | Shane Parrish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-GtGH57J9I)  
- [Big Think : Want to get more from books? Stop reading them cover to cover. | Shane Parrish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fvUYmJcqWg)

### Projects
I have been tracking all the projects that I have been working on.
There are over 20 of them. None are never trully done.  
There is always something else to thinker with. Something else to learn.  

They are my creative outlet. It is probably one of the things I enjoy doing the most in life.
Some of them are pretty cool and worth sharing, I think :)

### Fuck Yeah List
That is right. A "Fuck Yeah List".  
I learned this "concept" from [Doc James Whittaker](http://www.docjamesw.com/).  
It is simple a list of accomplishments that I am proud of.  
Whenever I need a pick me up, I can come here and read "my fuck yeah list" and feel better about myself.
