Here is a few things that is he intested in the tech domain:</br>
</br>
<b>XR (eXtended Reality):</b></br>
This domain is the tech I am most passionated about it. There is still so much to build and create in this domain. I can easily see myself retiring wearing an XR headset (and/or lenses!).
</br></br>
<b>Decentralization:</b></br>
My favorite initiatives are Mastodon, Solid.mit.edu / Inrupt. To me, Blockchain is one of the foundations for a robust decentralized system. However, as you can see with Solid and Inrupt, not everything needs to be on a blockchain.
</br></br>
<b>Artificial Intelligence:</b></br>
AI is changing the world. We need to make sure that we create AIs in an ethical and open way so that everyone can benefit from the power that this technology can bring. Inevitably, there will be private AI solutions, but like Linux, the foundation of AI should be open to all.
