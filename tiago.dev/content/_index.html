</br> </br>

A few domains that he is interested in:</br>
</br>
<b>XR (eXtended Reality):</b></br>
This domain is the tech I am most passionated about it. There is still so much to explore and create in this domain.
</br></br>
<b>Decentralization:</b></br>
My favorite initiatives are <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Solid.mit.edu</a> / <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/" target="_blank">Inrupt</a>.</br>
To me, a great tech for decentralization is Blockchain. I think it can be used for very robust decentralized systems. However, as you can see with Mastodon, Solid, and Inrupt, not everything needs to be on a blockchain.
</br></br>
<b>Artificial Intelligence:</b></br>
AI is changing the world. We need to make sure that we create AIs in an ethical and open way so that everyone can benefit from the power that this technology can bring. Inevitably, there will be private AI solutions, but like Linux, the foundation of AI should be open to all.
