This is seems to be a really good book!  
The book is about "nurturing the good and managing the bad"  
In this post I talk about:
- Why did I decide to listen to this book?
- What do I think I will learn from this book?
- My thoughts after listening the prologue

# Why did I decide to listen to this book?
I heard about Bob Iger after reading an article that mentioned that the CEO of Disney was thinking of running for the president of the USA.  
I love Disney, but never really knew anything about their CEO so I looked him up.  

and guess what?  
He has done some pretty amazing shit!  
I watched a couple of interviews he gave and I really liked the way he talked:
- very precise
- very calm
- never rushing
He really came across to me as a leader.  

In one of his recent interviews, he was promoting his new book. This book.
- The Ride of a Lifetime - Lessons learned from 15 years as CEO of Disney

So as to the question "Why did I decide to listen to this book?"  
Given his achievements, given my love for Disney and the way I perceived him...  
I thought that I could learn something from his book.  

# What do I think I will learn from this book?
I actually had no idea what I would be learning.  
However, I knew I would learn something.

# Thoughts after listening the prologue
The prologue was very interesting and it got me hooked.  
He started in a very unusual way.  
It didn't really make sense why he was telling some specific stories...  
... until it clicked.
  
  
He starts talking about how he wanted to retire after opening Disney Shangai - that was 11 years of being a CEO.  
However, life doesn't always goes as planned.  
and then he shifted to telling two stories:
- A massacre that happened near Disney at a night club : [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting)
- About a child who was killed by an alligator inside Disney's resort. : [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting)

It didn't quite make sense why he was telling these stories, but then I realized that he was setting up the scenarios in which showed how compartmentalization and relying on other people is really important.

Towards the end of the prologue he mentions what this book is about.
In his words, "this book is about how to nurture the good and deal with the bad"  

This got me really excited for reading the rest of the book!
This is something I think I do really well.  
Yet, I know that there is much to learn on how to nurture the good and deal with the bad.  
Bad things happens all the time every where.  
One thing that has helped me a lot in life, when bad things happen to you, is that...  
- is is not about what happens to you, it is about what you do when it happens.
If you use that framework, you are in control when things go bad.
