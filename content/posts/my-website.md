I am still shaping this tool on how I want it.  
So this post is still in progress...


## Fuck Yeah List
That is right. A "Fuck Yeah List".  
I learned this "concept" from [Doc James Whittaker](http://www.docjamesw.com/).  
It is simple a list of accomplishments that I am proud of.
So whenever I need a pick me up, I can come here and read "my fuck yeas" and feel better about myself.

## Critical Reading and Retaining Knowledge
I read about a method of reding books that helps with retaining and understanding what you read better.  
In short words, the method goes like this:
- write what you think you are going to be reading
- read a chapter
- write about what you have just read
- before you start reading the book again, read through your notes

I have started doing that and I liked it a lot.  

Here are some videos on the method I described:
- [Big Think : How to remember everything you read | Shane Parrish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-GtGH57J9I)  
- [Big Think : Want to get more from books? Stop reading them cover to cover. | Shane Parrish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fvUYmJcqWg)

## Projects
I have tons of side projects.  
AS an effort to organize them more,  
I am going to start doing the same thing that I am doing with the books I am reading.  

Write about my projects:
- Why am I doing it
- What I have done
- What I want to do next
